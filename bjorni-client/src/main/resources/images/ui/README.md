# UI Assets

## Digital Clock

Save the digital clock image (the yellow/gold pixel art frame with white screen) as:
- **Filename:** `digital-clock.png`
- **Location:** This folder (`src/main/resources/images/ui/`)

The digital clock frame will be used to display the game time on the background wall.
The time text will appear centered within the white screen area of the clock frame.

### Current Implementation
- Position: X:450, Y:95 (above TV, to the right)
- Size: 80x40 pixels (scaled with window)
- The clock automatically updates with the game time in HH:MM format
